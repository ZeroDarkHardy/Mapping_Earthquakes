# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

This project involves gathering earthquake data from GeoJSON files, obtained through the USGS API.  The data is then visualized on an interactive map, with multiple background and overlay layers.  Each recorded earthquake (within the last 7 days) is visualized by a color coded marker, with the size and color corresponding to the magnitude of the earthquake.

## Resources

- Data: [USGS Earthquakes GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson), [USGS Major Earthquakes (4.5 magnitude and above) GeoJSON](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_week.geojson), [Techtonic Plates GeoJSON](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fraxen/tectonicplates/master/GeoJSON/PB2002_boundaries.json) provided by GitHub user Fraxen.
- Software/Languages: JavaScript, Visual Studio Code 1.63.2, Leaflet 1.7.1, Leaflet 1.6.0, HTML/CSS, D3.js v5
